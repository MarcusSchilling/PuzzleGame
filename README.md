# PuzzleGame
A Puzzle Game made up off custom pictures. TRY IT!!!
## Instructions: 
The game is based on a quadratic field flexible on size.  
You must bring the shuffled Picture parts to the correct positions means change the shuffeld back to the original photo. 
For this you can press a button on the corners which effects a move in the direction from the row or column.

## Customize
You can choose a picture from your own pictures after you have played one game just go on the text box at the bottom and press F1. Or type in the textbox a correct picture path.
Therefor change in Constant.java rows and cols size on your own the game board will be responsive fitted but be careful there are boundaries for example a 40x40 board leads to issues.

And now have fun!

## Technical:
It's based on swing. That was not my decision Iâ€™m a big fan of JavaFX but the project was originally a school project so this was required! 
So, try it out it works on both MacOS and Windows as well as on Linux!
Have fun!
