# PuzzleGame
A Puzzle Game made up off custom pictures. TRY IT!!! The project was developed within the scope of a school project.

## Instructions: 
 At the beginning of the game the picture is divided into w x h fields and then shuffled. The goal of the game is to move the picture parts back to the correct positions.  To do this, you can press a button at the corners that causes a shift in the direction of the row or column of the pictures.
 
## Customize
You can use your own image for the game. If you want to change the image after you have won, just go to the text field below the image and press F1. Then a selection window appears in which you can choose your image. You can also manually enter the image path in the text box.
Constants.java is for customization purposes.

And now have fun!
